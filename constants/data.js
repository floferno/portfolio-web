      "I am a web (*cough* a little bit of a weeb too *cough*) developer, coding teacher, and digital illustrator. I love to create things that live on the internet that *hopefully* please the eye. My goals are to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, excellent performance experiences, and share stuff I know to others",

      `I've been interested in programming since high school and self-teaching it in my spare time as a mere hobby but I had taken a break for several years due to the lack of motivation and time.`,
      `In 2020, I was at the peak of feeling stuck and anxious of my career hence I decided to learn programming more intensively and seriously while still doing my daytime job by enrolling in Hacktiv8's Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp, Freecodecamp, some other online courses such as Web Programming Unpas, BuildWithAngga, Coursera, and Udemy. I also found myself a supportive mentor in MOFON Indonesia who helps me deepen my programming understanding.`,
      `After what I've learned so far, I've decided to focus more on being a Front-End Developer as my starting career in IT industry. I'm so pumped up to learn, grow, and put my skills to greater use in the future! ðŸ”¥`
